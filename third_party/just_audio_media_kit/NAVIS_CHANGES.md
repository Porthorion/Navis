# Navis just_audio_media_kit extension

Based on just_audio_media_kit 2.1.0 (Unlicense); original license is retained.

Indexed seeks reset playback readiness before media_kit jumps to the entry.
The deferred-seek helper replaces any previous pending position and omits zero:
a freshly loaded entry starts at zero, so sending an extra seek while mpv is
loading only produces a rejected-command error. Non-zero positions remain
pending until the new entry reports playback initialization or a positive
duration; the previous entry's cached duration cannot authorize a seek.
Seeks without an indexed jump retain their existing behavior. Upstream
media_kit's seek-on-completed behavior in `play()` is unchanged.

Keep upgrades narrow and re-run the vendored adapter fixtures and Navis
playback tests when updating this package.
