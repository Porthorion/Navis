# Navis just_audio extension

Based on just_audio 0.10.6 (MIT); original license and platform sources are
retained. The matching 4.6.0 platform interface is vendored separately.

Navis adds a typed, player-scoped parametric EQ configuration and status API.
Configurations are retained across idle/native player transitions. Android
installs a Media3 PCM processor after the existing silence/speed processors,
with independent filter history per output channel. Configurations cross from
the control thread to the processing thread at audio-block boundaries.

This extension does not replace Media3, audio_service, source loading, audio
focus, media sessions, or the Apple playback backend. Other backends may
implement the extension; unimplemented calls fail explicitly. Original system
audio effects remain available to upstream callers, but Navis retires their
experimental EQ/loudness UI and uses its own processing path.

Keep upgrades narrow and re-run the native response/lifecycle fixtures and
Navis playback tests when updating either vendored package.
